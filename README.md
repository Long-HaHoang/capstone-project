# Capstone Mini Store

For my capstone project, I created a simple eCommerce shop using a variety of modern web development tools and technologies. The backend of the application is powered by MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database that provides flexibility and scalability.

To manage the state of the application, I used Zustand, a state management library that allows for easy sharing of state between components. In addition, I utilized the use-immer hook, which simplifies state management by enabling immutable updates to state.

To style the components of the eCommerce shop, I used the styled-components library, which provides a way to create reusable and composable styled components. This helped me to create a cohesive and visually appealing user interface.

For server-side rendering, I chose Next.js, a React framework that provides out-of-the-box features such as automatic code splitting and optimized performance. This made it easier to develop a fast and responsive eCommerce shop.

Lastly, I used the SWR hook, a data fetching library, to simplify the process of fetching data from the server and caching it for future use. This helped to improve the performance of the application by reducing the number of network requests.

Overall, my capstone project demonstrates my ability to design and build a modern web application using a variety of cutting-edge tools and technologies. The eCommerce shop showcases my skills in back-end development, state management, user interface design, and performance optimization.
