# Capstone Mini Store

For my capstone project, I created a simple eCommerce shop using modern web development tools and technologies. The backend of the application is powered by MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database that provides flexibility and scalability.

To manage the state of the application, I used Zustand, a state management library that allows for easy sharing of state between components. This made it easier to keep track of the user's shopping cart and display the appropriate information throughout the application.

One of the key features of the eCommerce shop is the shopping cart, which allows users to add and remove items, see a summary of their purchases, and complete the checkout process. To make the shopping experience more realistic, I fetched dummy product data from a database and displayed it on the front end.

Overall, my capstone project demonstrates my ability to design and build a modern web application using the latest tools and technologies. The eCommerce shop showcases my skills in back-end development, state management, and user interface design
